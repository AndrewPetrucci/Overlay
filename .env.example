# Twitch OAuth Setup

To connect your overlay to Twitch chat, you'll need OAuth tokens. Here's how to get them:

## Getting OAuth Token for Your Bot

1. Go to https://twitchtokengenerator.com/
2. Click "Generate Token"
3. Select "Chat Bot" as the type
4. Authorize with your Twitch account
5. Copy the OAuth token (format: `oauth:xxxxxxxxxxxxx`)

## Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in your project root:

```bash
TWITCH_BOT_USERNAME=your_bot_username
TWITCH_OAUTH_TOKEN=oauth:your_token_here
TWITCH_CHANNEL=your_channel_name
```

Load the `.env` file at the start of main.js with `require('dotenv').config()` (optional, but recommended).

## Testing Connection

Run the app in dev mode to see connection logs:

```bash
npm run dev
```

You should see "Connected to Twitch Chat" in the console.

## Securing Your Token

⚠️ **Important**: Never commit your `.env` file to git. Add it to `.gitignore`:

```
.env
.env.local
node_modules/
dist/
```

Store tokens in environment variables or use a secrets manager for production builds.
